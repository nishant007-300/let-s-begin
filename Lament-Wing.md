# Lament Wing

Once there was a bird with a chirp and chirp,
Her wings were strong and huge and sharp;
Mother made a nest with a little care,
But she flew over, foot completely bare;
Was unknown to the world she thought it good,
It broke her heart as much it could;
The flower was in grief, moon's eyes in tears,
Could not do anything but disgrace it wears;
Her name was valour she sounds with a growl,
Her crown was broken, her sword fell down;
Mother still waiting food in her hand,
But the bird is resting laying in the sand.
